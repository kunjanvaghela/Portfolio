        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I like to deliver high-quality products which satisfy all of the given requirements, and to exceed expectations.

            After finishing bachelor's, I started my professional journey in Tech Mahindra, working as a Software Engineer/Quality Analyst for the client KPN. With a strong zeal to deliver the best product possible, I oversaw the consolidation of 40+ applications into a single application, migration of customers (with no disruption) from one Telco to another, built configuration and automation scripts, ensuring that the software delivered was top-notch by working diligently with the clients, the whole team, and various other stakeholders involved.
            
            Whenever I did not get it right, I learned, and I am still learning like any other Machine Learning Algorithm :)
            And this zeal to learn more has landed me into Rutgers where I am pursuing my grad degree in CS. I am currently experimenting with data structures, ML models, cloud technologies, and numerous algorithms. I love to share new concepts that I come across, and would be glad to learn something new from you!
            
            If you would like to have me on your team, you can reach me on LinkedIn or send me an email at kunjanvaghela@gmail.com
